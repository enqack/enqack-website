## New content

I'm in the process of added new content to the site that I hope will be useful to some; unlike my earlier content.

I added some hex code charts and a shortcut document for the [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com/products/m8-tracker-model-02). I also added a shortcut document for the [Synthstrom Audible Deluge](https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/) as well as a resource website list.

## Learning the Deluge

I recently picked up a Deluge from [Detroit Modular](https://detroitmodular.com) and have being spending time with it writing loops and working with it's deeper functionality. But mostly struggling with remembering all the shortcuts. I have also refactored the [midi2deluge html/js version](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/blob/community/contrib/midi2deluge/midi2deluge.html) to be a responsive page using the Hugo/Docsy bootstrap component. A hugo free version can be found in the gist at: https://gist.github.com/enqack/1223bf039aad64c2a5ad507078265d04.

## Future

I will continue to add to the topics I have in place so far. I'm also looking to add even more content related to projects I'm working on soon<sup>TM</sup>.  I also have some theme work I'd like to do revolving around Docsy's color pallet.
