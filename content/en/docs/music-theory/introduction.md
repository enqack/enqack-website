Learning basic music theory can greatly enhance your experience with synthesizers and sequencers. It’s not required to make music, but it helps you build **chords, melodies, and rhythms** faster and more musically【126†source】.  
This guide introduces the core ideas — **notes, scales, chords, progressions, rhythm**, and how they apply to grid-based devices like the **Synthstrom Deluge**.

## The Musical Alphabet: Notes and Octaves

Western music uses **12 notes per octave**, named **A–G** with sharps (♯) and flats (♭) for the five “in-between” tones.  
Example: A, A♯/B♭, B, C, C♯/D♭, D, D♯/E♭, E, F, F♯/G♭, G, G♯/A♭, then repeating【126†source】.

- **Half step** = 1 semitone (e.g. C → C♯)  
- **Whole step** = 2 semitones (e.g. C → D)  

Sharps and flats are **enharmonic** (C♯ = D♭).  
An **octave** spans 12 semitones — moving up an octave doubles the frequency of a note.  

On the **Deluge grid**, each row represents a pitch; in **Chromatic mode** rows are semitone steps, while **Scale mode** shows only notes in your selected key【126†source】.

## Scales and Keys

A **scale** is a set of notes forming a musical palette. The **root** (or tonic) names the key — e.g. the C major scale defines the key of C major.

### Major Scale
Pattern: **W–W–H–W–W–W–H**  
Example: C D E F G A B (C).  
It sounds **bright or happy**.

### Minor Scale
Pattern: **W–H–W–W–H–W–W**  
Example: A B C D E F G (A).  
It sounds **moody or emotional**【126†source】.

Each major scale has a **relative minor** (A minor is relative to C major).

On the **Deluge**, Scale Mode keeps you in key automatically. Rows represent only valid scale notes.  
You can change the **root** (e.g., from C to A) or switch to another mode (Dorian, Phrygian, etc.) to explore different moods【126†source】.

## 🎶 Chords and Harmony

A **chord** is two or more notes played together.  
Most basic chords are **triads** — three stacked notes built by skipping every other note in a scale.

### Common Triads
- **Major (happy):** root + 4 semitones + 7 semitones  
  → Example: C–E–G  
- **Minor (sad):** root + 3 semitones + 7 semitones  
  → Example: A–C–E【126†source】.

### Diatonic Chords in C Major
| Degree | Chord | Quality |
|---------|--------|----------|
| I | C major | Major |
| ii | D minor | Minor |
| iii | E minor | Minor |
| IV | F major | Major |
| V | G major | Major |
| vi | A minor | Minor |
| vii° | B diminished | Diminished |

Minor keys have a slightly different pattern, often borrowing chords from related scales【126†source】.

### Popular Progressions
A **chord progression** is a repeating pattern of chords.  
One of the most common is the **I–V–vi–IV** sequence:
> C → G → A minor → F  

Heard in countless synthwave and pop songs (like *Take On Me* by A-ha).  
The same pattern in A minor would be written **i–VI–III–VII**【126†source】.

When programming chords on a sequencer, place multiple notes in the same column (same time).  
Stretch notes horizontally to make them sustain.  
Use the **audition pads** on the Deluge to preview notes before placing them【126†source】.

## Melodies and Basslines

A **melody** is a sequence of single notes forming a musical phrase.  
Good melodies balance **pitch movement** (steps and leaps) and **rhythm** (placement in time).

### Tips for Melodies
- **Stay in key:** Stick to scale notes.  
- **Land on chord tones:** Strong beats sound best on notes from the current chord.  
- **Mix steps and leaps:** Mostly stepwise motion with occasional jumps for energy.  
- **Repeat and vary:** Short motifs with small rhythmic or melodic changes stay catchy【126†source】.

You can record melodies live or step-sequence them on the grid.

### Basslines
A **bassline** anchors the harmony and rhythm. Start with the **root note** of each chord (e.g. C–A–F–G for C–Am–F–G).  

Enhance with:
- **Octave jumps** (C → C’)  
- **Fifths** (C → G)  
- **Passing tones** between chords【126†source】  

Basslines often mirror the **kick drum rhythm** for a solid groove.

## Rhythm and Sequencing

**Rhythm** is how music moves in time — the pattern of beats and note lengths.

- **4/4 time** = 4 beats per bar  
- **Tempo (BPM)** = beats per minute  
- On most sequencers, **16 steps = 1 bar** at default 1/16 resolution【126†source】.

### Basic Beat Example (4/4)
| Instrument | Steps | Pattern |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Kick | 1, 5, 9, 13 | Downbeats |
| Snare | 5, 13 | Backbeats |
| Hi-hat | 3, 7, 11, 15 | Offbeats【126†source】 |

### Concepts
- **Offbeats:** Notes between main beats for groove.  
- **Syncopation:** Accenting offbeats for energy.  
- **Swing:** Shifts timing of every second 16th note slightly for a “shuffle” feel【126†source】.

Each row = an instrument or note, and columns = time positions.  
Experiment with patterns — drums, bass, chords, and melody should complement each other rhythmically.

## Bringing It Together on the Deluge

1. **Set the Key:** Choose your scale and root note (e.g., E♭ minor for dark synthwave).  
2. **Program Chords:** Input simple progressions like *E♭m–B♭m–A♭m–B♭m* or *C–G–Am–F*.  
3. **Add a Bassline:** Use chord roots and rhythmic accents.  
4. **Craft a Melody:** Follow scale tones and chord changes.  
5. **Layer and Arrange:** Add variation, automate filters, and build sections【126†source】.

Remember — theory is a **tool**, not a rulebook.  
Experiment freely: sometimes the best moments come from “wrong” notes or unexpected timing.  
As your ear improves, these concepts will help you **create intentionally** and faster【126†source】.
